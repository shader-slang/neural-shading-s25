# Automatic Differentiation Examples

This folder contains some simple examples demonstrating automatic differentation in Slang.

These examples are written as stand-alone Slang programs that can be executed by the Slang byte-code interpreter (`slangi`).

## Instructions to Run

- Download latest Slang release at https://github.com/shader-slang/slang/releases/latest.
- Run `slangi` tool from the release, with the path to one of the `.slang` files in this directory as argument.
  For example `slangi square.slang`.
