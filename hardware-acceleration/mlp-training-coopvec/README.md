Slang "MLP-Training-CoopVec" Example
==========================

This example shows how to use the Slang to train a feed-forward neural network
using automatic differentiation and the cooperative vector intrinsics. Also see the
"MLP-Training" example for the same task without using cooperative vector.

Platform Compatibility:
- This example is currently supported only on Windows and Linux with NVIDIA GPUs
- macOS is not supported at this time
- Cooperative vector features require an NVIDIA GPU
