Slang "MLP-Training" Example
==========================

This example shows how to use the Slang to train a feed-forward neural network
using automatic differentiation. Also see the "MLP-Training-CoopVec" example
to see how to use the cooperative vector intrinsics to speedup training.

Platform Compatibility:
- This example is supported on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- Uses Vulkan on Windows/Linux and Metal on macOS
